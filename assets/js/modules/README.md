# Site Modules

Should contain any custom JS modules created specifically for this website. Do not place 3rd party libraries or scripts into this directory.

All files defined within this directory will automatically be added to the compiled `site.min.js` file. 

Modules should be registered with the global `SITE` object (see example).
