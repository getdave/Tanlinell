// IE MASTER
// We define a master-ie.scss file which is included for old-IE only via conditional comments
// This file has no differences at all from the standard master.scss file other than the following
// variable which is used to trigger specific behaviour for old IE


$is-oldie: true !default;

// Breakpoint size at which we don't want to serve any media queried blocks to
// this ensures that oldie doesn't get served CSS designed for super-wide screens
