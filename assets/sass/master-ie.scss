// IE MASTER
// We define a master-ie.scss file which is included for old-IE only via conditional comments
// This file has no differences at all from the standard master.scss file other than the following
// variable which is used to trigger specific behaviour for old IE


$is-oldie: true;

// Uncomment to activate IE styles
//@import "master.scss";
