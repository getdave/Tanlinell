Description: Tanlinell is a[nother] Wordpress Theme Boilerplate created for rapid development of WP Themes. It aims to reduce the initial overhead of Theme development by providing many of the common WP Theme requirements out of the box. The word "Tanlinell" means "Underscore" in Welsh, but whilst the theme is based on the fantastic work of the Wordpress Core Theme team's Underscore theme it takes things a little further. This may be good/bad, depending on your preference. Tanlinell is brought to you by David Smith and the team at Burfield.
