  "readme": "## grunt-rsync\n\nA Grunt multitask for accessing the file copying and syncing capabilities of the rsync command line utility. Uses the [rsyncwrapper](https://github.com/jedrichards/rsyncwrapper) npm module for the core functionality.\n\n### Grunt compatability\n\n- `v0.1.0` and above should be Grunt `v0.4` compatible\n- `v0.0.5` and below are Grunt `v0.3` compatible\n\nIf you're upgrading to Grunt `v0.4` you shouldn't need to make any changes to your existing `grunt-rsync` task config, just be sure to `npm install` the latest version. But be sure to place an issue if you have any problems.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nA reasonably modern version of rsync (>=`v2.6.9`) in your `PATH`.\n\n### Installation\n\n    $ npm install grunt-rsync\n\n### Usage\n\nAdd a `rsync` object to your Grunt config and `grunt.loadNpmTasks(\"grunt-rsync\")`.\n\nAll options defined in the config are passed verbatim to [rsyncwrapper](https://github.com/jedrichards/rsyncwrapper), so check that project's readme for more details on the possible options.\n\nFor example, the following task config defines three targets. The `dist` target could be used to create a distribution of a website ready for deployment, excluding files related to Git and uncompiled SCSS. The `deploy-staging` and `deploy-live` targets could be used to copy the distribution to the relevant remote hosts over ssh.\n\n```javascript\nrsync: {\n    dist: {\n        src: \"./\",\n        dest: \"../dist\",\n        recursive: true,\n        exclude: [\".git*\",\"*.scss\"]\n    },\n    \"deploy-staging\": {\n        src: \"../dist/\",\n        dest: \"/var/www/site\",\n        host: \"user@staging-host\",\n        port: \"1234\", // Use the rsyncwrapper port option to set a non-standard ssh port if required.\n        recursive: true,\n        syncDest: true\n    },\n    \"deploy-live\": {\n        src: \"../dist/\",\n        dest: \"/var/www/site\",\n        host: \"user@live-host\",\n        recursive: true,\n        syncDest: true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Wildcards, exclude patterns, globbing etc.\n\nAny wildcards, exclude patterns and globbing of paths are handled by rsync itself. So importantly this task does **not** use Grunt's in-built path expanding and globbing. For more information on rsync's syntax check the [rsync manpages](http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync). For information about how this task's options relate to rsync's functionality check [rsyncwrapper](https://github.com/jedrichards/rsyncwrapper).\n\n### Testing\n\nBasic tests are run on [Vows Async BDD](http://vowsjs.org/) via this package's Gruntfile. To test `grunt-rsync` clone the repo and install the devDependancies:\n\n    $ npm install --dev\n\nNext you'll have to install the Node `vows` npm package globally, and ensure you've got `grunt-cli` working. Then:\n\n    $ npm test",
