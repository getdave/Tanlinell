# Tanlinell - a[nother] Wordpress Theme Boilerplate 

Tanlinell is a[nother] Wordpress Theme Boilerplate created for rapid development of WP Themes. It aims to reduce the initial overhead of Theme development by providing many of the common WP Theme requirements out of the box.

The word "Tanlinell" means "Underscore" in Welsh, but whilst the theme is based on the fantastic work of the Wordpress Core Theme team's Underscore theme it takes things a little further. This may be good/bad, depending on your preference.


Tanlinell is brought to you by myself and the team at [Burfield Creative](http://burfieldcreative.co.uk).


## Usage

To use this project simply clone the repo using:

git clone --recursive git://github.com/foo/bar.git

Note the use of the --recursive flag. This tells git to fetch the files for the submodules contained within the repo (eg: Hybrid Core).
